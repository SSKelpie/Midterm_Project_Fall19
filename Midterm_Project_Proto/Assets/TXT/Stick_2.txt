Hi again! H-how did it go?
Elderberry tea? Sounds like a good choice! I'm glad you talked to them. 
They... didn't seem lonely, maybe tired of being alone, ya know? 
A-anyway, I'm glad you came back!
... you seem familiar. Like us, but newer? More recent?
... I'll remember eventually. 
But for now, you should go order yourself a drink! But before you go...
I think the Rum Cake of Resolve might pair well with it! Try it!
