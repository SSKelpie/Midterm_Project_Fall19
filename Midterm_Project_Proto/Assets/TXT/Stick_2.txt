Hi again! H-how did it go?
Elderberry tea? Sounds like a good choice! I'm glad you talked to them. They... didn't seem lonely. But maybe tired of being alone, ya know? A-anyway, I'm glad you came back.
... you seem familiar. Like us, but newer. O-or older, is the better word? 
... I'll remember eventually. But for now, you should go order yourself a drink! But before you go...
I think the Rum Cake of Resolve might pair well with it! Try it!
