O-oh hi!... How's it going? You waiting for your order?
...you haven't decided what to get?
 W-well, I really liked this Chai of Resolve, and some softer happier sympathetic sweets to balance out, ... all of Skully's edge over there.
 Not that it's bad! But there's always going to be some light moments to balance out the dark ones. 
 Even if they don't look the way you expect them to look.
... Why don't you t-try saying hello, then tell me how it went? I'm sure they don't mind the chat.
